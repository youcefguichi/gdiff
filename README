Todo:
- update generateDiff function to display deletedline addedline under each other
- update lcs to only use prev table calculation
- think about how to structure the diffing, should you return the diffing list or how you should do it
- don't forget to do the unit tests
- check how your function naming should be in Go
- how to create debug.json in VS Code
