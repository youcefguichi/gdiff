Todo:
- update generateDiff function to display deleted line addedline under each other
- update lcs to only user prev table calculation
- think about how to structure the diffing, should you return the diffing list or how you should do it
- don't forget to do the unit tests
- check how you function naming should be in go 
- how to create debug.json in vs code
- does calculating a hash can make the calculation faster ?
- display the number of lines that have the change
